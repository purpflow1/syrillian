//! GPU rendering backend built on top of `wgpu`.
//!
//! The rendering module is responsible for preparing GPU resources,
//! building command buffers and drawing the world each frame.
//!
//! As a user, you don't usually need to interact with the things in here,
//! besides the [`AssetCache`].
//!
//! See documentation of [`World`](crate::World) to find out how to add GPU data.
//!
//! To retrieve meshes, or other things, you'll use Handles, defined as [`H<T>`](crate::assets::H),
//! but for cleanliness it's appropriate to use the types like [`HMesh`](crate::assets::HMesh).
//!
//! These handles are indices into the [`AssetStore`](crate::assets::AssetStore), and serve as a
//! combined handle into the [`AssetCache`]. The [`AssetStore`](crate::assets::AssetStore) is
//! where you can put your raw data, which is then initialized by the AssetCache on the GPU.
//!
//! You'll usually only interact with the Cache or something like that, in a
//! [`Render Proxy`](proxies::SceneProxy), which is Syrillians abstraction for
//! render-side drawable world state, which knows how to render the state the proxy represents.
//!
//! In a [`Scene Proxy`](proxies::SceneProxy) you'll want to interact with the
//! [`GPUDrawCtx`] object that contains all info for the frame, and inner-frame draw call.
//!
//! Creating a scene proxy is or >should< usually not be necessary as you can just spawn a builtin
//! scene proxy in your Component
//!
//! You can create scene proxies in [`Components`](crate::components)
